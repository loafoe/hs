# hs - healthy scripter
hs is a command line interface (CLI) to interact with various HSDP services.
It primarily uses [go-dip-api](https://github.com/dip-software/go-dip-api) so whatever functionality is available from that library and makes sense to expose via CLI will be considered.

# usage
It's still early days for this project. Use `-h` to get an overview of all commands and parameters
