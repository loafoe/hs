# hs - handy scripter
hs is a command line interface (CLI) to interact with various HSDP services.
It primarily uses [go-hsdp-api](https://github.com/philips-software/go-hsdp-api) so whatever APIs get exposed by that library will be added, if it makes sense.

# usage
It's still early days for this project. Use `-h` to get an overview of all commands and parameters
